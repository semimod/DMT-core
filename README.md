DeviceModelingToolkit (DMT) is a Python tool targeted at helping modeling engineers extract model parameters, run circuit and TCAD simulations and automate their infrastructure.

See the [DMT-website](https://dmt-development.gitlab.io/dmt-core/index.html) for further information.

## Installation

After installing python 3.8 or later, simply install the release version using

```bash

    python3 -m pip install DMT-core[full]

```

For more information have a look at our [install guide](https://dmt-development.gitlab.io/dmt-core/installation/install_dmt.html)

Currently DMT is developed mostly on Ubuntu using Python 3.10. So for the easiest install this is the best supported plattform.
If you want or have to use Windows and MacOS there may be more dependency and installation issues, although needed projects we use support these plattforms. Please report these issues to us. In our install guide, we collect guides to solve the already known issues.
