The resulting modeling approach takes as inputs the dimensions of emitter fingers, shallow and deep trench isolation, their relative locations and the temperature dependent material thermal conductivity. Coupling coefficients obtained from the model are first validated against 3D TCAD simulations including the effect of BEOL followed by validation against measured data obtained from state-of-art multifinger SiGe HBTs of different emitter geometries.},

First we provide a physics-based formulation to find out the coupling factors in a multifinger structure having no-trench isolation (cij,nt). As a second step, using the value of cij,nt, we propose a formulation to estimate the coupling factor in a multifinger structure having only shallow trench isolations (cij,st). Finally, the coupling factor model for a deep and shallow trench isolated multifinger device (cij,dt) is presented. The proposed modeling technique takes as inputs the dimensions of emitter fingers, shallow and deep trench isolations, their relative locations and the temperature dependent material thermal conductivity. Coupling coefficients obtained from the model are validated against 3D TCAD simulations of multifinger bipolar transistors with and without trench isolations.

abstract = {Starting with the simplest semiclassical approaches and ending with the description of complex fully quantum-mechanical methods for quantum transport analysis of state-of-the-art devices, Computational Electronics: Semiclassical and Quantum Device Modeling and Simulation provides a comprehensive overview of the essential techniques and methods for effectively analyzing transport in semiconductor devices. With the transistor reaching its limits and new device designs and paradigms of operation being explored, this timely resource delivers the simulation methods needed to properly model state-of-the-art nanoscale devices. The first part examines semiclassical transport methods, including drift-diffusion, hydrodynamic, and Monte Carlo methods for solving the Boltzmann transport equation. Details regarding numerical implementation and sample codes are provided as templates for sophisticated simulation software. The second part introduces the density gradient method, quantum hydrodynamics, and the concept of effective potentials used to account for quantum-mechanical space quantization effects in particle-based simulators. Highlighting the need for quantum transport approaches, it describes various quantum effects that appear in current and future devices being mass-produced or fabricated as a proof of concept. In this context, it introduces the concept of effective potential used to approximately include quantum-mechanical space-quantization effects within the semiclassical particle-based device simulation scheme. Addressing the practical aspects of computational electronics, this authoritative resource concludes by addressing some of the open questions related to quantum transport not covered in most books. Complete with self-study problems and numerous examples throughout, this book supplies readers with the practical understanding required to create their own simulators.},

It implements the forward mode of automatic differentiation using the arithmetic of dual numbers and the operator overloading feature of F90/ 95/2003. Very minimum changes of the source codes are needed to compute the first derivatives of Fortran programs. The advantages of DNAD in comparison to other existing similar computer codes are its programming simplicity, extensibility, and computational efficiency. Specifically, DNAD is more accurate and efficient than the popular complex-step approximation. Several examples are used to demonstrate its applications and advantages. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Computational efficiency and accuracy of the numerical modeling are the key criteria on which quality and usefulness of a TCAD tool are ascertained.

In this paper, we provide an overview of the new device simulator NESS (Nano-Electronic Software Simulator) developed at the University of Glasgow's Device Modelling Group. It is a fast and modular TCAD tool with flexible architecture and structure generation capabilities, and contains different modules including classical, semi-classical, and quantum transport solvers, mobility calculation, kinetic Monte-Carlo and others. NESS can also take into account various sources of statistical variability in nanodevices and can perform simulations of thousands of microscopically different devices created by the structure generator.

abstract = {The carrier transport in advanced SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) process technologies exhibits bandgap-related transport effects that not only impact the transconductance and output conductance characteristics, but are also difficult to describe accurately by compact models. This paper addresses the modeling of bandgap-related effects in the collector current by formulating an improved version of a generalized integral charge-control relation (GICCR). As a result, the experimentally observed degradation of the transconductance at low and medium current injection, which is a strong function of the Ge grading, as well as the output conductance are described by simple bias-and temperature-dependent formulations of the GICCR weight factors. The derived formulations fit seamlessly into the compact model HICUM/L2. The extended model shows excellent agreement over a wide bias and temperature range with the experimental data of a large variety of SiGe HBTs from technologies of different manufacturers, including production and most advanced lab processes. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Both compound semiconductor and silicon-based bipolar junction transistors or heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) require the efficient removal of heat in order to achieve a maximum level of performance and reliability. In order to satisfy both of these criteria, the electrothermal behavior of each device must be captured in a compact model. The model parameter that determines the junction temperature is RTH, the thermal resistance. Experimental methods to determine RTH often require a relatively small device with a large R TH to be attached to a set of relatively large metal pads with a low RTH. The pads act as a thermal shunt to the substrate and artificially lower the measured RTH. In order to obtain a suitable RTH value for a device located in an IC, the pads must be deembedded from the measured data, much like pad deembedding for an S-parameter measurement. Test structures with various width metal traces between the emitter pad and device's emitter have been fabricated in a 200-GHz InP double HBT process. A method of using the measured RTH of these structures and a simple resistive network model to deembed the pads is presented. It is shown that deembedded values can be as much as 30% higher than the measured RTH. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

This includes materials with graded composition, like heterojunctions, with nonuniform temperature or strain, and devices with highly doped regions, like the emitter region of modern bipolar transistors and solar cells. Size effects, such as those in short-channel MOS transistors, are not considered. Changes in the energy band edges due to spatial variations in electron affinity and bandgap and changes in the density of states produce terms in the carrier- and current-density equations in addition to those found in the conventional Shockley model. This paper emphasizes the physical concepts underlying these modifications and provides a theoretical framework from which experimental results can be correctly interpreted. The new effects are derived and discussed. Areas which require further research are pointed out. The paper discusses the validity and meaning of a nonuniform band structure. The general energy-band diagram relating the electrostatic potential, the electron affinity, and the bandgap is given. Expressions for current density are derived from a solution of the Boltzmann equation. Expressions for nonequilibrium carrier densities are presented. The effective mass approximation and the rigid band model are discussed. The concepts of generalized drift and diffusion are established and alternative formulations are given.

While the drift-diffusion model is not capable of handling nonlocal effects, the latter model group provides a more accurate description. Several variants of hydrodynamic and energy-transport models have been published so far. Recent results show, however, that the average energy is in many cases not sufficient for accurate modeling.

abstract = {It is shown that the conductance in nanoscale devices near equilibrium strongly depends on the choice of the transport model. Errors larger than a factor of two can be encountered, if the drift-diffusion (DD) model is used instead of a model based on the full Boltzmann equation. This effect is due to a fundamental difference in carrier heating between bulk systems and devices. Although carrier heating is included in hydrodynamic models, this effect is captured only partially by these models due to the model inherent approximations. A direct consequence of the failure of the DD approximation is that the usual method for inversion layer mobility extraction from measurements in the linear regime becomes inaccurate for short gate lengths and the extracted mobilities might be too small. This error has also an impact on the modeling accuracy at strong nonequilibrimn. In the case of the DD model, the overestimation of the conductivity in the linear regime can partly compensate the underestimation of the current at high bias, and the model accidentally appears to be more accurate than expected. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

This ensures that the complete measurement environment like probes, pads and access lines along with the appropriate layouts are precisely included in the EM simulation framework. In order to additionally include the active device like SiGe HBTs, technology computer aided design (TCAD) tool is used to simulate the device S-parameters. TCAD simulation results are fed into an EM-plus-SPICE simulation framework to emulate a complete on-wafer measurement environment.

abstract = {In certain types of heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), the carrier transit time associated with the base-collector (BC) space-charge region constitutes a significant contribution to the total transit time. In many compact models, the low-current BC transit time is lumped in with the total low-current transit time and often assumed to be constant - dependent only on the collector width and material saturation velocity. This assumption, however, is insufficient for modeling high-voltage Si-based HBTs as well as for III-V HBTs, where the negative differential mobility (NDM) effect can become relevant in high-speed low-power circuits. This paper presents a closed-form solution for the low-current collector transit time based on a novel accurate analytical velocity-field formulation, covering both group IV and group III-V semiconductor materials. The new solution includes the NDM effect and is suitable for implementation in compact models, and its relevance and accuracy are demonstrated for both TCAD simulated and measured data.},

abstract = {A detailed theoretical and numerical analysis of the electrothermal behavior of single-finger bipolar transistors is proposed. Two models of different complexities are introduced to investigate self-heating effects in bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) biased with a constant base-emitter voltage source or with a constant base current source. In the constant base-emitter voltage case, simple relations are derived for determining the onset of the flyback behavior in the output characteristics which defines the boundary of the safe operating region. The model indicates that the flyback behavior disappears at high VBE Values, and predicts a thermal hysteresis phenomenon at high currents. It is also shown that at high current levels the electrothermal behavior is dominated by ohmic base pushout. If a constant base current is applied, the model shows that both BJTs and HBTs are unconditionally thermally stable. The transient behavior is also considered, and the temperature evolution is investigated for different bias conditions. The model shows that, if the device is biased in the thermally unstable region, thermal breakdown occurs within a finite time instant in the limit case of a zero ballast resistance. Finally, the reduction in the safe operating area due to avalanche effects and to the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity is discussed, and a simplified model is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

The physical interpretation of such results in terms of the usual regional model is greatly facilitated by a new partition of the small-signal charge distribution. Only two region boundaries remain to be determined. The criterion employed for this purpose is unambiguous. The total transit time from emitter contact to collector contact (inversely proportional to fT) is subdivided into five physically meaningful components. The method can readily be implemented in device simulation programs, making these easier to use as a design tool. It provides more detailed insight into the influence of the emitter doping gradient on fT. Examples illustrate the three effects that can cause the fT fall-off at high collector current densities: high injection in the base, base widening and quasi-saturation. In all cases the emitter transit time turns out to dominate the total transit time at very high current densities, albeit beyond the limit of practical interest. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

@article{VanVliet1986,
abstract = {Optical (real) bandgap narrowing is due to the change in bottom of conduction band and top of valence band, leading to a gap shift ℰc−ℰv = ℰ g 0 − $\Delta$ℰg, where ℰ g 0 is the low doping standard band‐gap. In electrical measurements, an electrical (apparent) bandgap narrowing is derived from the altered pn product n ie2 = n i02 exp ($\Delta$G0/kT); here n i02 is the low doping standard pn product, being the square of the intrinsic carrier density. It is shown that $\Delta$G0 = $\Delta$ℰg + $\theta$ n0 + $\theta$ p0; $\Delta$ℰg is the rigid band shift, but $\theta$ n0 and $\theta$ p0 involve the effects of Fermi statistics as well as of the altered entire density of states in the presence of heavy doping. Optical and electrical bandgap narrowing can only be concordant if $\theta$ n0 and $\theta$ p0 are explicitly computed. A preliminary computation is made, using the quantum mechanical data of Lowney and Bennett for a donor doping of 9.64 × 1019 cm−3. The optical bandgap change $\Delta$ℰg for that doping at 300 K is known to be close to 83 meV. The additional change due to $\theta$ n0 + $\theta$ p0 is computed to be 10.1 meV. Thus the electrical bandgap narrowing is larger than the optical bandgap narrowing, the total effect (≈ 93 meV) being in good agreement with the recently compiled data by del Alamo et al.

In the SEB model, the energy-relaxation length is estimated from a pre-process drift-diffusion simulation using the carrier-velocity distribution predicted throughout the device domain, and is used without change in a subsequent simpler hydrodynamic (SHD) simulation. The new SEB model was verified by comparison of two-dimensional SHD and full HD DC simulations of a submicron MOSFET. The SHD simulations yield detailed distributions of carrier temperature, carrier velocity, and impact-ionization rate, which agree well with the full HD simulation results obtained with FLOODS. The most noteworthy feature of the new SEB/SHD model is its computational efficiency, which results from reduced Newton iteration counts caused by the enhanced linearity. Relative to full HD, SHD simulation times can be shorter by as much as an order of magnitude since larger voltage steps for DC sweeps and larger time steps for transient simulations can be used. The improved computational efficiency can enable pragmatic three-dimensional SHD device simulation as well, for which the SEB implementation would be straightforward as it is in FLOODS or any robust HD simulator. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

on a solution of the drift-diffusion (DD) equations. In this work,
the DD equations are tested on advanced SiGe HBTs at very high frequencies.
To do so, a way how to obtain valid results from numerical DD-Simulation
in future, has been described. In the next step the ‘Transient
Integral Charge Control Relation' (TICCR) was investigated. This
equation is based on drift and diffusion, too, but it includes further
time dependent terms. Using these, the TICCR not only offers a valid
calculation of the terminal currents, but additionally the internal
charges of a HBT. This is confirmed in this work and used on current
and predicted HBTs. It was shown, that the TICCR allows modelling
in the submillimetre wavelength region. Furthermore the possible
choices for the integral borders are examined, by this it was shown,
that the terminals are the best choice from a compact modelling point

The electronic chip is becoming an ever-increasing portion of system solutions, starting initially from less than 5% in the 1970 microcomputer era, to more than 60% of the final cost of a mobile telephone, 50% of the price of a personal computer (representing nearly 100% of the functionalities) and 30% of the price of a monitor in the early 2000's. Interest in utilizing the (sub-)mm-wave frequency spectrum for commercial and research applications has also been steadily increasing. Such applications, which constitute a diverse but sizeable future market, span a large variety of areas such as health, material science, mass transit, industrial automation, communications, and space exploration. Silicon-Germanium Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors for mm-Wave Systems Technology, Modeling and Circuit Applications provides an overview of results of the DOTSEVEN EU research project, and as such focusses on key material developments for mm-Wave Device Technology. It starts with the motivation at the beginning of the project and a summary of its major achievements. The subsequent chapters provide a detailed description of the obtained research results in the various areas of process development, device simulation, compact device modeling, experimental characterization, reliability, (sub-)mm-wave circuit design and systems.},

The electromagnetic behavior of these elements, as well as their coupling to the host transmission line, are studied, and analytical equivalent-circuit models are proposed for the isolated and coupled SRRs/CSRRs. From these models, the stopband/passband characteristics of the analyzed SRR/CSRR loaded transmission lines are derived. It is shown that, in the long wavelength limit, these stopbands/passbands can be interpreted as due to the presence of negative/positive values for the effective $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ of the line.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations.

This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

The proposed VCO employs series varactors in feed-back paths in addition to varactors in tank circuit. By controlling both varactors, this VCO achieves wide tuning range compared to the conventional LC cross-coupled VCO. Furthermore, appropriately biased MOS varactors for feed-back paths realize linear tuning performance. The proposed configuration is experimentally validated with a 0.35$\mu$m SiGe-BiCMOS fully integrated VCO. The oscillation frequency of the fabricated VCO varies 14.3GHz to 16.2GHz with 12.5% tuning range, which is increased by 120% from that of the conventional LC cross-coupled VCO.

abstract = {Many of the small satellites which have been launched or designed to date have used Frequency Shift Keyed (FSK) modulation for the communications link. FSK necessarily suffers a best-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss of 3 dB for coherent demodulation. Many, if not most, of the FSK systems in use today employ non-coherent demodulation which suffers additional SNR loss. This means that small satellites using FSK must use two or more times the minimum power required for the communications link. A small satellite using two watts for an FSK communications link could save at least 1 watt by using Bi-Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) or one of the other power-optimal modulations. This saved power would then be available for payloads or for increased data communications. Alternately, a satellite with one-half the solar-cell surface area could be used. cynetics Corporation has tested a commercially available 9.6 Kb/sec communications system which uses asynchronously detected, non-coherent FSK. This system has a measured implementation loss of 23.6 dB, which is roughly 20 dB worse than the 3 dB implementation loss one might expect. When the additional 3 dB FSK loss is considered, this system was 23 dB worse than a simple BPSK system with a 3 dB implementation loss. This means that this FSK system would require two hundred times (23 dB) as much satellite transmitter power as a reasonable BPSK system.},

Since then SRR has been a major topic of interest in the metamaterial research fraternity. A complete review on the working of SRR, pros and cons of using SRR in microwave applications over other naturally existing magnetic materials is presented in this paper.

abstract = {There are many types of oscillators, and many different circuit configurations that produce oscillations. Some oscillators produce sinusoidal signals, others produce nonsinusoidal signals. Nonsinusoidal oscillators, such as pulse and ramp (or saw- tooth) oscillators, find use in timing and control applications. Pulse oscillators are commonly found in digital-systems clocks, and ramp oscillators are found in the horizontal sweep circuit of oscilloscopes and television sets. Sinusoidal oscillators are used in many applications, for example, in consumer electronic equipment (such as radios, TVs, and VCRs), in test equipment (such as network analyzers and signal generators), and in wireless systems. In this chapter the feedback approach to oscillator design is discussed. The oscillator examples selected in this chapter, as well as the mix of theory and design information presented, help to clearly illustrate the feedback approach. The basic components in a feedback oscillator are the amplifier, an amplitude- limiting component, a frequency-determining network, and a (positive) feedback network. Usually the amplifier also acts as the amplitude-limiting component, and the frequency-determining network usually performs the feedback function. The feedback circuit is required to return some of the output signal back to the input. Positive feedback occurs when the feedback signal is in phase with the input signal and, under the proper conditions, oscillation is possible.},

Moreover, the shunt capacitance also allows easier biasing, making tunable filters using varactors realizable.

abstract = {The first edition of "Microstrip Filters for RF/Microwave Applications" was published in 2001. Over the years the book has been well received and is used extensively in both academia and industry by microwave researchers and engineers. From its inception as a manuscript the book is almost 8 years old. While the fundamentals of filter circuits have not changed, further innovations in filter realizations and other applications have occurred with changes in the technology and use of new fabrication processes, such as the recent advances in RF MEMS and ferroelectric films for tunable filters; the use of liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrates for multilayer circuits, as well as the new filters for dual-band, multi-band and ultra wideband (UWB) applications. Although the microstrip filter remains as the main transmission line medium for these new developments, there has been a new trend of using combined planar transmission line structures such as co-planar waveguide (CPW) and slotted ground structures for novel physical implementations beyond the single layer in order to achieve filter miniaturization and better performance. Also, over the years, practitioners have suggested topics that should be added for completeness, or deleted in some cases, as they were not very useful in practice. In view of the above, the authors are proposing a revised version of the "Microstrip Filters for RF/Microwave Applications" text and a slightly changed book title of "Planar Filters for RF/Microwave Applications" to reflect the aforementioned trends in the revised book. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {SAW resonators are particularly suitable for passive wireless sensing because of the high Q factor (storage of rf energy) and the possibility to change their resonance behaviour influenced by an external measurand (frequency pulling). The sensor is build not only by a physical affecting of the acoustic wave but also by an electrical interaction outside the resonator (e.g. capacitive or inductive). The sensor signal is determined by the external circuit elements and manifests in a frequency and amplitude shift. The pulling frequency and the optimum pulling span, also the transmitted power are estimated by the external reactive circuit elements, as well as by the SAW-Resonator characteristic. To obtain the maximum power transmission, a matching between the sensor element and the antenna for wireless interrogation is necessary; simultaneously, one element of the matching network is the sensing element that pulls the frequency. For well-designed sensors, the parameters of equivalent circuitry of the resonator have to be estimated with a high accuracy, in order to simulate the resonator pulling in combination with different matching networks. Thus, from all the L-, Pi- and T-sections, the eligible configuration were selected and tested in order to ensure the maximum power transmission in a wide pulling range. This paper presents simulation and experimental results for designing proper sensor systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

Closed-form explicit analytical equations are derived for modeling the emitter size dependence of the low-current minority charge and transit time, the critical current indicating the onset of high injection in the collector, and the stored minority charge in the collector at high injection. These equations are suited for application in various compact transistor models such as the SPICE Gummel-Poon model (SGPM) as well as the advanced models HICUM and MEXTRAM. As demonstrated by two- and three-dimensional device simulation and measurements, combination of the derived equations with HICUM results in accurate prediction of the characteristics of transistors with variable emitter length and width. As a consequence, the new model makes the conventional transistor library unnecessary and offers bipolar circuit designers the flexibility to use the transistor size that fits the application best.},

abstract = {The notion of control dependence underlies many program analysis and transformation techniques. Despite being widely used, existing definitions and approaches to calculating control dependence are difficult to apply directly to modern program structures because these make substantial use of exception processing and increasingly support reactive systems designed to run indefinitely. This article revisits foundational issues surrounding control dependence, and develops definitions and algorithms for computing several variations of control dependence that can be directly applied to modern program structures. To provide a foundation for slicing reactive systems, the article proposes a notion of slicing correctness based on weak bisimulation, and proves that some of these new definitions of control dependence generate slices that conform to this notion of correctness. This new framework of control dependence definitions, with corresponding correctness results, is even able to support programs with irreducible control flow graphs. Finally, a variety of properties show that the new definitions conservatively extend classic definitions. These new definitions and algorithms form the basis of the Indus Java slicer, a publicly available program slicer that has been implemented for full Java. {\textcopyright} 2007 ACM.},

Rust also offers a clear performance model, making it easier to predict and reason about program efficiency. One important way it accomplishes this is by allowing fine-grained control over memory representations, with direct support for stack allocation and contiguous record storage. The language balances such controls with the absolute requirement for safety: Rust's type system and runtime guarantee the absence of data races, buffer overflows, stack overflows, and accesses to uninitialized or deallocated memory.

abstract = {Numerous research groups are currently developing high-performance InP HBTs with fT and fMAX greater than 400 GHz. However, the heavily degenerate doping concentrations used in these devices present new challenges to numerical device simulation. This work focuses on three physical phenomena in InP and In0.53Ga0.47As and their implementation in physics based device simulators. First, the use of the parabolic band approximation yields a constant DOS effective mass, but this results in an erroneously deep Fermi-level under heavily degenerate donor concentrations. An empirical model is presented and shown to have good agreement with previously published simulations and experimental data. Second, bandgap narrowing parameters and a table based model are used as a more generic model for compound semiconductors. Third, calculated parameters to address the Mott transition are used to obtain the proper free-carrier concentrations throughout the HBT. The improper calibration or neglect of these three physical phenomena is shown to alter HBT band profiles at thermal equilibrium by as much as 400 meV; the turn-on voltage by approximately 50 mV; and the fT dependence on JC by approximately 18%. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Self-consistent numerical solutions are obtained for equations describing carrier transport, carrier generation, and space-charge balance. The solutions describe the evolution in time of the diode and its associated resonant circuit. Detailed solutions are presented of the hole and electron concentrations, electric field, and terminal current and voltage at various points in time during a cycle of oscillation. Large-signal values of the diode's negative conductance, susceptance, average voltage, and power-generating efficiency are presented as a function of oscillation amplitude for a fixed average current density. For the structure studied, the largest microwave power-generating efficiency (18 percent at 9.6 GHz) has been obtained at a current density of 200 A/cm2, but efficiencies near 10 percent were obtained over a range of current density from 100 to 1000 A/cm2.

The simulation shows that intervalley electron transfer plays a dominant role in high electric fields leading to a strongly inverted electron distribution and to a large negative differential conductance. Our simulation results have also shown that the electron velocity in InAs and AlAs is less sensitive to temperature than in other III-V semiconductors like GaAs and AlGaAs.

abstract = {Transport equations are derived for particles, momentum, and energy of electrons in a semiconductor with two distinct valleys in the conduction band, such as GaAs. Care is taken to state and discuss the assumptions which are made in the derivation. The collision processes are expressed in terms of relaxation times. The accuracy is improved by considering these to depend on the average kinetic energy rather than the electron temperature. Other transport equations used in the literature are discussed, and shown to be incomplete and inaccurate in many cases. In particular, the usual assumption that the mobility and diffusion constant depend locally on the electric field strength is shown to be incorrect. Rather, these quantities should be taken as functions of the local average velocity of electrons in the lower valley.

abstract = {An overview of the transport equations describing electron and hole motion and density in solids with nonuniform band structure is presented. This includes materials with graded composition, like heterojunctions, and devices with highly doped regions, like the emitter region of modern bipolar transistors and solar cells. Effects due to carrier degeneracy, changes in the energy band edges, and changes in the density of states produce terms in the carrier- and current-density equations in addition to those found in the conventional Shockley model. These new terms are derived and discussed. The general energy-band diagram relating the electrostatic potential, electron affinity and bandgap is given. The current densities are written in terms of gradients of quasi-Fermi level and the carrier densities in terms of normalization integrals. The concepts of generalized drift and diffusion are discussed. Connections to the work by Van Overstraeten et al. and to Lundstrom et al. are given. The transport equations in the nondegenerate limit are presented. The special case of minority-carrier flow in quasi-neutral material is given. Key approximations used in device analysis are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Conduction in materials with a position-dependent band structure, such as graded band gap semiconductors and graded heterojunctions, is considered. A brief discussion of the meaning of spatially varying band structure, based on an extension of Wannier's theorem, is given. Using this extended theorem, it is shown that the conventional Boltzmann transport equation is inadequate for the situation under discussion; a generalized form of the Boltzmann transport equation is derived. From this the complete electron and hole currents are obtained. Besides drift, chemical, and thermal diffusion, they contain two extra terms. One of these involves the gradient of the electron affinity and of the band gap, while the other one depends on the gradient of the density of states. The results thus extend previous results by van Ruyven and Williams and by van Overstraeten et al. It is further shown that the results can be transformed to a form which resembles the conventional current equations, providing a modified position-dependent mobility and diffusivity are introduced. A discussion of the realm of applicability of these results is also presented. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {Since the mid-20th Century the electronics industry has enjoyed phenomenal growth and is now the largest industry in the world. The foundation of the electronics industry is the semiconductor device. To meet the tremendous demand of this industry, the semiconductor-device field has also grown rapidly. Coincident with this growth, the semiconductor-device literature has expanded and diversified. For access to this massive amount of information, there is a need for a book giving a comprehen- sive introductory account of device physics and operational principles. With the intention of meeting such a need, the First Edition and the Second Edition of Physics of Semiconductor Devices were published in 1969 and 198 1, respectively. It is perhaps somewhat surprising that the book has so long held its place as one of the main textbooks for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in applied physics, electrical and electronics engineering, and materials science. Because the book includes much useful information on material parameters and device physics, it is also a major reference for engineers and scientists in semicon- ductor-device research and development. To date, the book is one of the most, if not the most, cited works in contemporary engineering and applied science with over 15,000 citations (ISI, Thomson Scientific). Since 198 1, more than 250,000 papers on semiconductor devices have been pub- lished, with numerous breakthroughs in device concepts and performances. The book clearly needed another major revision if it were to continue to serve its purpose. In this Third Edition of Physics of Semiconductor Devices, over 50% of the material has been revised or updated, and the material has been totally reorganized. We have retained the basic physics of classic devices and added many sections that are of con- temporary interest such as the three-dimensional MOSFETs, nonvolatile memory, modulation-doped field-effect transistor, single-electron transistor, resonant-tun- neling diode, insulated-gate bipolar transistor, quantum cascade laser, semiconductor sensors, and so on. On the other hand, we have omitted or reduced sections of less- important topics to maintain the overall book length. We have added a problem set at the end of each chapter. The problem set forms an integral part of the development of the topics, and some problems can be used as worked examples in the classroom. A complete set of detailed solutions to all end-of- chapter problems has been prepared. The solution manuals are available free to all adopting faculties. The figures and tables used in the text are also available, in elec- tronic format, to instructors from the publisher. Instructors can find out more informa- tion at the publisher's website at http://ww.wiley.com/interscience/sze. In the course of writing this text, we had the fortune of help and support of many people. First we express our gratitude to the management of our academic and indus- trial institutions, the National Chiao Tung University, the National Nan0 Device Lab- oratories, Agere Systems, and MVC, without whose support this book could not have been written.

@article{Conwell1966,
abstract = {Use of the drifted Maxwellian distribution is shown to be unjustified for GaAs samples in which the Gunn effect is usually observed, because the carrier concentration is much too low for electron-electron collisions to pre-dominate. It is pointed out that solution of the Boltzmann equation is considerably simpler at fields high enough so that the average electron energy exceeds several times the optical phonon energy. The simplification occurs because the polar optical scattering may then be considered elastic. Relaxation times and rates of energy loss in acoustic, optical, and intervalley scattering are examined in order to determine which scattering processes must be included in the Boltzmann equation. It is found that intervalley scattering is very likely to be more important than polar optical scattering for high-energy electrons in either the central or the outer valleys. Approximate solutions of the Boltzmann equation for electrons in the lower valley are given for a wide range of fields. The number of electrons per unit energy range, calculated from the solution of the Boltzmann equation, is given for electrons in both valleys for a field of 2.4 × 103 volts/cm, where the approximation mentioned should be reasonably good. {\textcopyright} 1966, IEEE.

These approaches include the single-valley, two-valley displaced Maxwellian, and the two-valley macro-kinetic hydrodynamic transport models. Results obtained from these transport models are compared with those from Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that the transport parameters and rate coefficients obtained from the displaced Maxwellian approach, in the case of no electron-electron scattering, significantly deviate from Monte Carlo results in hot-electron situations. In addition, the displaced Maxwellian distribution results in less pronounced velocity overshoot behaviour. Insufficient information on intervalley transfer in extreme non-equilibrium cases provided by the single-valley hydrodynamic model is also illustrated. Results clearly show that in non-equilibrium and hot-electron situations the single-valley approach actually provides a much better transport description for electrons in the two-valley semiconductor than the two-valley displaced Maxwellian hydrodynamic approach. Moreover, the previously developed macro-kinetic approach is shown to be in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo method in extreme non-equilibrium and hot-electron situations.},

All transport coefficients may be interpreted in terms of well-known thermodynamic effects and, hence, can be obtained from theoretical calculations as well as directly from experimental data. The thermodynamic model allows the consistent treatment of a wide variety of physical phenomena which are relevant for both the operation of electronic devices (e.g., lattice heating, hot carrier and low temperature effects) and the function of microsensors and actuators (e.g., thermoelectricity, galvanomagnetism and thermomagnetism). {\textcopyright} 1991, MCB UP Limited},

@article{McKelvey1961,
abstract = {A novel method of solving added carrier transport problems in semiconductors is presented. The usual procedure in treating problems of this type is to derive a continuity equation for charge carriers on the basis of carrier conservation, allowing for generation and recombination, and to solve this equation under appropriate boundary conditions. The resulting fluxes or currents are obtained from diffusion and drift current equations, which involve the concentrations and concentration gradients. In the formulation presented here, equations embodying conservation of flux (again with due allowance for generation and recombination) which incorporate the proper boundary conditions from the outset are solved in the steady-state one-dimensional case to yield a Green's function for the desired carrier fluxes directly. The method is more general than the commonly used continuity equation formulation in that the physical dimensions of the system and the diffusion lengths are not restricted to be large compared to the mean free path; in particular it is unnecessary to assume Fick's law for diffusion processes. Otherwise the method is equivalent to the continuity equation analysis. An example involving carrier generation in a plane region bounded on one side by a surface of arbitrary reflection coefficient (or recombination velocity) and on the other by a collecting p-n junction is worked out. The results are shown to reduce to those obtained via the continuity equation in the appropriate limiting case. {\textcopyright} 1961 The American Physical Society.},

When the drain voltage is low, this model shows that the drain current increases stepwise with increasing gate voltage, and the transconductance vs. gate voltage displays spikes. These features are the most evident signatures of 1-D transport. Next, we examine the finite-temperature performance numerically and show how I-V characteristics change as device parameters and temperature are varied. Finally, recently reported silicon NW gate-all-around MOSFETs are analyzed with our model. We show that some quantum features of these experiments can be explained with our simple, ballistic model.

abstract = {In certain types of heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), the carrier transit time associated with the base-collector (BC) space-charge region constitutes a significant contribution to the total transit time. In many compact models, the low-current BC transit time is lumped in with the total low-current transit time and often assumed to be constant - dependent only on the collector width and material saturation velocity. This assumption, however, is insufficient for modeling high-voltage Si-based HBTs as well as for III-V HBTs, where the negative differential mobility (NDM) effect can become relevant in high-speed low-power circuits. This paper presents a closed-form solution for the low-current collector transit time based on a novel accurate analytical velocity-field formulation, covering both group IV and group III-V semiconductor materials. The new solution includes the NDM effect and is suitable for implementation in compact models, and its relevance and accuracy are demonstrated for both TCAD simulated and measured data.},

abstract = {The electron current in a semiconductor at uniform lattice temperature T0, with a nonuniform electric field distribution (e.g., a barrier layer), consists of terms arising from conduction, diffusion, and thermal diffusion. The first two terms involve the mobility and diffusion coefficient which are functions of the electron temperature T or, more generally, depend on certain averages over the nonequilibrium, field-dependent electron energy distribution function. The third term is due to the electron temperature gradient and is analogous to conventional thermal diffusion of a gas in a temperature gradient. In conventional theory, which neglects electron heating or cooling, the mobility and diffusion coefficient are material constants and thermal diffusion is absent. Contrary to the case of uniform fields, T is not a unique function of the local field; it also depends on the current and can only be determined by a simultaneous solution of the equations for current flow and conservation of energy with boundary conditions for a particular structure. As an example, a one carrier metal-semiconductor contact rectifer has been analyzed in detail including a discussion of the Peltier effect. In the barrier region T is greater than T0 (i.e., hot electrons) for a reverse bias but less than T0 (i.e., cold electrons) for a forward bias. Computer solutions have been obtained for a Schottky barrier and electron scattering due to acoustic phonons only. {\textcopyright} 1962 The American Physical Society.},

@phdthesis{gehring,
abstract = {MICROELECTRONICS has reached a point where quantum effects have a major impact on the electrical characteristics of semiconductor devices. One of the most important effects in this regime is the quantum-mechanical tunneling of carriers through thin dielectric layers. On the one hand, this leads to increased power consumption and thus limits the thickness of the gate dielectric. On the other hand, tunneling effects are used in non-volatile memory devices to transfer charge to an isolated floating gate.The tunneling current is caused by the transition of carriers from one electrode through a classically isolating region to another electrode. Three major factors influence this process: the carrier energy distribution at both electrodes, the quantum-mechanical transmission coefficient of the energy barrier between the electrodes, and the presence of traps in the insulating layer which may assist in the tunneling process.The carrier energy distribution is of major importance for the tunneling process. The FERMI-DIRAC or MAXWELL-BOLTZMANN distribution is frequently used to approximate this distribution. These expressions are, however, only valid near equilibrium and fail to describe the distribution of hot carriers. In this work an alternative expression for the distribution function, which is based on the carrier concentration, temperature, and kurtosis, was applied. This distribution shows good agreement with results from simulations and accurately reproduces the high-energy tail of the distribution. The heated MAXWELLian distribution, which only accounts for the electron concentration and temperature, completely fails to reproduce the high-energy tail and highly overestimates the tunneling current density.The quantum-mechanical transmission coefficient is calculated by solving the stationary SCHROEDINGER equation in the region considered for tunneling. The coefficient depends on the shape of the energy barrier in the dielectric layer. Dielectrics which consist of a single layer give rise to a linear potential variation in the barrier, yielding either a trapezoidal or a triangular band diagram. Analytical models can be derived to approximately calculate the transmission coefficient in these cases, based on the WENTZEL-KRAMERS-BRILLOUIN approximation or on GUNDLACH's formula.With reduced device dimensions, however, the gate dielectric in MOS devices must be scaled accordingly which, for the commonly used material SiO _2, leads to an intolerably high gate current density. To overcome this problem, gate dielectric stacks including high- $\kappa$ dielectrics have been proposed.In such dielectric stacks the band profile has a non-linear shape, and models based on triangular or trapezoidal barriers are no more valid. Instead, SCHROEDINGER's equation must be solved using the transfer-matrix or the quantum transmitting boundary method. These methods have been studied and the quantum transmitting boundary method was found superior due to its better numerical stability and the possibility to apply it to two- and three-dimensional problems.Non-volatile memory devices need to endure up to 10^5 write and erase cycles at a voltage of 8-12V. This repeated high-field stress introduces defects in the tunneling dielectric, which give rise to trap-assisted tunneling current at low electric fields. That trap generation is considered a major reason for device degradation. In this work trap-assisted tunneling is modeled as a two-step process during which energy relaxation by phonon emission takes place. The trap occupancy in the dielectric is described by a time-dependent rate equation. To solve this equation, an iterative procedure is applied.Models to describe the outlined processes have been implemented into the general-purpose device simulator MINIMOS-NT. Several applications are investigated, where a distinction between MOS transistors and non-volatile memory devices is made. The applicability of alternative dielectric materials is investigated and, as an example, a MOS capacitor with a ZrO _2 dielectric is simulated and compared with measurements. Non-volatile memory devices such as conventional EEPROM devices, trap-rich dielectric devices, multi-barrier tunneling devices, and devices which use layered tunnel barriers to improve the retention time are investigated. With the implemented models, MINIMOS-NT can be used for the evaluation of tunneling currents in device structures of arbitrary complexity.},

Under these circumstances, the classical formulation is not sufficient to model the capacitance. Similarly, the exponential spatial doping dependence in the collector of modern high-speed HBTs may require a more in-depth approach.

abstract = {Many challenges faced in today's semiconductor devices are related to self-heating phenomena. The optimization of device designs can be assisted by numerical simulations using the non-isothermal drift-diffusion system, where the magnitude of the thermoelectric cross effects is controlled by the Seebeck coefficient. We show that the model equations take a remarkably simple form when assuming the so-called Kelvin formula for the Seebeck coefficient. The corresponding heat generation rate involves exactly the three classically known self-heating effects, namely Joule, recombination and Thomson–Peltier heating, without any further (transient) contributions. Moreover, the thermal driving force in the electrical current density expressions can be entirely absorbed in the diffusion coefficient via a generalized Einstein relation. The efficient numerical simulation relies on an accurate and robust discretization technique for the fluxes (finite volume Scharfetter–Gummel method), which allows to cope with the typically stiff solutions of the semiconductor device equations. We derive two non-isothermal generalizations of the Scharfetter–Gummel scheme for degenerate semiconductors (Fermi–Dirac statistics) obeying the Kelvin formula. The approaches differ in the treatment of degeneration effects: The first is based on an approximation of the discrete generalized Einstein relation implying a specifically modified thermal voltage, whereas the second scheme follows the conventionally used approach employing a modified electric field. We present a detailed analysis and comparison of both schemes, indicating a superior performance of the modified thermal voltage scheme.},

abstract = {3-D thermal analyses of state-of-The-Art silicon-germanium heterojunction bipolar transistors are performed with the aim of improving the simulation accuracy with respect to conventional approaches. Toward this goal, a nonuniform heat source obtained from calibrated electrical simulation results is considered, and thermal conductivity variations due to germanium mole fraction, doping profile, and thin-layer effects are accounted for. The cooling action of the backend metallization due to the upward heat flow, which is commonly disregarded, is then quantified for each layer.},

@article{Wachutka1990,
abstract = {Not only in power electronics but in particular in the field of VLSI and ULSI, the influence of self-heating on the performance of a semiconductor device proves to be more and more crucial as the power density dissipated within the device increases in consequence of enhanced functional integration. Device modeling allows for such self-heating effects by the coupled simulation of both the electrical and thermal device behavior (i.e., besides the carrier densities, temperature has to be included as additional position- and time-dependent state variable). However, up to now only heuristically motivated models of heat flow and generation have been proposed. In this paper, a physically rigorous treatment of the problem is presented. It is based on the laws of phenomenological irreversible thermodynamics (e.g., Onsager's relations and conservation of total energy) and, moreover, it is also consistent with the physical models usually considered in the isothermal drift diffusion approximation. The “classical” isothermal device equations are extended and completed by a generalized heat conduction equation involving heat sources and sinks which, besides Joule and Thomson heat, reflect the energy exchanged through (radiative and nonradiative) recombination and optical generation. Thus the extended model also applies to direct semiconductors (e.g., optoelectronic devices) and accounts for effects caused by the ambient light intensity. Furthermore, it fully allows for low temperature since the case of incomplete ionization of donors and acceptors (impurity freeze-out) is properly incorporated in the theory. A critical comparison with previous work is made; it shows that, in the steady state, some of the heuristic models of heat generation, thermal conductivity and heat capacity could indeed approximate the correct results within an error bound of 1-10%. In the transient regime, however, none of the models used previously seems to be reliable, in particular, if short switching times (< 10 ns) are attained and high current densities and steep temperature gradients are found. {\textcopyright} 1990 IEEE},
