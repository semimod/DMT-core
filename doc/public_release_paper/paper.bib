abstract = {The base series resistance is an important parameter for bipolar junction transistors and heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBTs). Although many methods have been proposed for its experimental determination, their results vary significantly. In this paper, the most widely used methods are reviewed and applied to SiGe HBTs of different technologies and generations including different device types, i.e. high-speed and high-voltage SiGe HBTs. The accuracy of the methods is evaluated by applying them to a sophisticated physics-based compact model, allowing to clearly detect and explain the causes for the observed inaccuracies or failures. The methods are then also applied to experimental data. In both cases, a large variety of device sizes have been investigated. This paper and its results provide insight into each method's accuracy, its application limits with respect to a technology, device size, and operating range as well as its requirements in terms of equipment and extraction effort.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new technique for the measurement of the thermal resistance of HBTs. The method is very simple, because it requires only standard de IC-VCE measurements taken at different baseplate temperatures, but it is able to account for the dependence of the thermal resistance on both the baseplate temperature and the dissipated power (under the simplifying assumption that the thermal resistance increases linearly with the dissipated power). We have obtained and shown consistent results extracted from devices with an emitter area ranging from 90 $\mu$m 2 (1 finger) to 1080 $\mu$m2 (12 fingers). The thermal-resistance values extracted with a standard and well-known technique are seen to fall inside the range of our results. We have also applied an alternative method that assumes a linear dependence between thermal resistance and junction temperature, and we have shown that both models lead to similar results, which points to the consistency and robustness of our extraction technique. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

The devices employ a 30 nm highly doped InGaAs base and a 150 nm InP collector containing an InGaAs/InAlAs superlattice grade. These devices exhibit a maximum fmax = 755 GHz with a 416 GHz f$\tau$. This is the highest fmax reported for a mesa HBT Through the use of i-line lithography, the emitter junctions have been scaled from 500-600 nm down to 250-300 nm - all while maintaining similar collector to emitter area ratios. Because of the subsequent reduction to the base spreading resistance underneath the emitter Rb,spread and increased radial heat flow from the narrower junction, significant increases to fmax and reductions in device thermal resistance $\theta$JA are expected and observed. The HBT current gain $\beta$ ≈ 24-35, BVceo = 4.60 V, BVcbo = 5.34 V, and the devices operate up to 20 mW/$\mu$m2 before self-heating is observed to affect the DC characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

First we provide a physics-based formulation to find out the coupling factors in a multifinger structure having no-trench isolation (cij,nt). As a second step, using the value of cij,nt, we propose a formulation to estimate the coupling factor in a multifinger structure having only shallow trench isolations (cij,st). Finally, the coupling factor model for a deep and shallow trench isolated multifinger device (cij,dt) is presented. The proposed modeling technique takes as inputs the dimensions of emitter fingers, shallow and deep trench isolations, their relative locations and the temperature dependent material thermal conductivity. Coupling coefficients obtained from the model are validated against 3D TCAD simulations of multifinger bipolar transistors with and without trench isolations. Geometry scalability of the model is also demonstrated.},

The analysis of its stationary solutions reveals the presence of bistability and hysteresis for a certain range of contact parameters. Several types of Gunn effect are predicted to occur in the model, when no stable stationary solution exists, depending on the value of the parameters of the injecting contact appearing in the boundary condition. In this way, the critical role played by contacts in the Gunn effect is clearly established. {\textcopyright} 1997 The American Physical Society.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This paper addresses the modeling of bandgap-related effects in the collector current by formulating an improved version of a generalized integral charge-control relation (GICCR). As a result, the experimentally observed degradation of the transconductance at low and medium current injection, which is a strong function of the Ge grading, as well as the output conductance are described by simple bias-and temperature-dependent formulations of the GICCR weight factors. The derived formulations fit seamlessly into the compact model HICUM/L2. The extended model shows excellent agreement over a wide bias and temperature range with the experimental data of a large variety of SiGe HBTs from technologies of different manufacturers, including production and most advanced lab processes. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

A simplified theory is employed to obtain a starting design. This design is then modified to achieve higher efficiency operation as specific device limitations are reached in large-signal (computer) operation. Self-consistent numerical solutions are obtained for equations describing carrier transport, carrier generation, and space-charge balance. The solutions describe the evolution in time of the diode and its associated resonant circuit. Detailed solutions are presented of the hole and electron concentrations, electric field, and terminal current and voltage at various points in time during a cycle of oscillation. Large-signal values of the diode's negative conductance, susceptance, average voltage, and power-generating efficiency are presented as a function of oscillation amplitude for a fixed average current density. For the structure studied, the largest microwave power-generating efficiency (18 percent at 9.6 GHz) has been obtained at a current density of 200 A/cm2, but efficiencies near 10 percent were obtained over a range of current density from 100 to 1000 A/cm2.

abstract = {Optical (real) bandgap narrowing is due to the change in bottom of conduction band and top of valence band, leading to a gap shift ℰc−ℰv = ℰ g 0 − $\Delta$ℰg, where ℰ g 0 is the low doping standard band‐gap. In electrical measurements, an electrical (apparent) bandgap narrowing is derived from the altered pn product n ie2 = n i02 exp ($\Delta$G0/kT); here n i02 is the low doping standard pn product, being the square of the intrinsic carrier density. It is shown that $\Delta$G0 = $\Delta$ℰg + $\theta$ n0 + $\theta$ p0; $\Delta$ℰg is the rigid band shift, but $\theta$ n0 and $\theta$ p0 involve the effects of Fermi statistics as well as of the altered entire density of states in the presence of heavy doping. Optical and electrical bandgap narrowing can only be concordant if $\theta$ n0 and $\theta$ p0 are explicitly computed. A preliminary computation is made, using the quantum mechanical data of Lowney and Bennett for a donor doping of 9.64 × 1019 cm−3. The optical bandgap change $\Delta$ℰg for that doping at 300 K is known to be close to 83 meV. The additional change due to $\theta$ n0 + $\theta$ p0 is computed to be 10.1 meV. Thus the electrical bandgap narrowing is larger than the optical bandgap narrowing, the total effect (≈ 93 meV) being in good agreement with the recently compiled data by del Alamo et al.

It is designed to support concurrency and parallelism in building applications and libraries that take full advantage of modern hardware. Rust's static type system is safe1 and expressive and provides strong guarantees about isolation, concurrency, and memory safety. Rust also offers a clear performance model, making it easier to predict and reason about program efficiency. One important way it accomplishes this is by allowing fine-grained control over memory representations, with direct support for stack allocation and contiguous record storage. The language balances such controls with the absolute requirement for safety: Rust's type system and runtime guarantee the absence of data races, buffer overflows, stack overflows, and accesses to uninitialized or deallocated memory.

This is due to nonlocal electron heating and the small width of the E-field peak. The simplified energy balance equation with the energy relaxation length lambda e as parameter gives the electron temperature for a given electric field distribution. From a series of MBE (molecular beam epitaxy)-grown bipolar transistors and scaled submicron MOS transistors, lambda e=650 AA was found. With the calculated temperature distribution and known empirical models for the impact ionization, avalanche (substrate) currents are accurately predicted. This procedure can easily be implemented, as postprocessing, in existing device simulators with hardly any extra computation time. It extends in a consistent way the validity range of these simulators to future device generations.},

As a draw-back of this “generalized ICCR” (GICCR) the required separation of the total minority charge q<inf>f</inf> into the contributions of the different transistor regions is not possible by measurements. Therefore, a simplified version of the GICCR is presented the parameters of which can be determined experimentally in a simple manner for the operating range of interest. This approach is well suited as a powerful basis for the development of compact HBT models for circuit simulation. The validity of the different approaches is verified by one-and two-dimensional device simulation for several practical SiGe-base HBT's with different doping profiles and Ge mole fractions. {\textcopyright} 1993 IEEE},

This paper presents a "turn-key" compact device modelling and circuit macromodelling system based on ADMS and implemented in the QucsStudio circuit design, simulation and manufacturing environment. A core feature of the new system is a modelling procedure which does not require users to manually patch the circuit simulator C++ code. At the start of a QucsStudio simulation the software automatically detects any changes in Verilog-A model code, re-compiling and dynamically linking the modified code to the body of the QucsStudio code. The inherent flexibility of the "turn-key" system encourages rapid experimentation with analogue and RF compact device models.

abstract = {The dependence of important transistor characteristics, such as transit frequency, on emitter width and length is modeled on a physical basis. Closed-form explicit analytical equations are derived for modeling the emitter size dependence of the low-current minority charge and transit time, the critical current indicating the onset of high injection in the collector, and the stored minority charge in the collector at high injection. These equations are suited for application in various compact transistor models such as the SPICE Gummel-Poon model (SGPM) as well as the advanced models HICUM and MEXTRAM. As demonstrated by two- and three-dimensional device simulation and measurements, combination of the derived equations with HICUM results in accurate prediction of the characteristics of transistors with variable emitter length and width. As a consequence, the new model makes the conventional transistor library unnecessary and offers bipolar circuit designers the flexibility to use the transistor size that fits the application best.},

@article{Chang1997,
abstract = {To pragmatically account for non-local carrier heating and hot-carrier effects such as velocity overshoot and impact ionization in multi-dimensional numerical device simulation, a new simplified energy-balance (SEB) model is developed and implemented in FLOODS[16] as a pragmatic option. In the SEB model, the energy-relaxation length is estimated from a pre-process drift-diffusion simulation using the carrier-velocity distribution predicted throughout the device domain, and is used without change in a subsequent simpler hydrodynamic (SHD) simulation. The new SEB model was verified by comparison of two-dimensional SHD and full HD DC simulations of a submicron MOSFET. The SHD simulations yield detailed distributions of carrier temperature, carrier velocity, and impact-ionization rate, which agree well with the full HD simulation results obtained with FLOODS. The most noteworthy feature of the new SEB/SHD model is its computational efficiency, which results from reduced Newton iteration counts caused by the enhanced linearity. Relative to full HD, SHD simulation times can be shorter by as much as an order of magnitude since larger voltage steps for DC sweeps and larger time steps for transient simulations can be used. The improved computational efficiency can enable pragmatic three-dimensional SHD device simulation as well, for which the SEB implementation would be straightforward as it is in FLOODS or any robust HD simulator. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The first scheme is also linear but includes additional terms that serve to maintain conservation to second order. The second scheme is a nonlinear exponential-fitting method that is more complicated but also more efficient than the linear schemes. The methods are evaluated numerically using device examples involving both quantum confinement and tunneling and are shown to perform quite well allowing for a substantial easing in the mesh refinement especially in tunneling problems.},

abstract = {Both compound semiconductor and silicon-based bipolar junction transistors or heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) require the efficient removal of heat in order to achieve a maximum level of performance and reliability. In order to satisfy both of these criteria, the electrothermal behavior of each device must be captured in a compact model. The model parameter that determines the junction temperature is RTH, the thermal resistance. Experimental methods to determine RTH often require a relatively small device with a large R TH to be attached to a set of relatively large metal pads with a low RTH. The pads act as a thermal shunt to the substrate and artificially lower the measured RTH. In order to obtain a suitable RTH value for a device located in an IC, the pads must be deembedded from the measured data, much like pad deembedding for an S-parameter measurement. Test structures with various width metal traces between the emitter pad and device's emitter have been fabricated in a 200-GHz InP double HBT process. A method of using the measured RTH of these structures and a simple resistive network model to deembed the pads is presented. It is shown that deembedded values can be as much as 30% higher than the measured RTH. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

We found that the model implementation of thermal resistance ( {R}-{\text {th}} ) based on only junction temperature is implicit requiring time-consuming iterative procedure which may lead to potential instabilities. Dedicated extraction techniques are proposed for obtaining compact model-specific {R}-{\text {th}} and its temperature coefficient. The proposed method is primarily validated on SPICE generated synthetic data. Next in order to showcase a compact model-independent verification, we also test the method using detailed thermal simulation from TCAD. Finally, we apply our extraction technique on measured data from fabricated transistors. The results are benchmarked to already obtained nominal {R}-{\text {th}} values from the same device family.},

Our results allow the extraction of bulk, in-plane and out-of-plane hole drift mobilities. Doping effects in SiGeC alloys are taken into account through an efficient ionized-impurity scattering model. This model is based on inverse momentum relaxation times derived from phase-shift theory.11Also known as partial-wave theory. A new alloy scattering model relevant to the case of random ternary alloys is presented. It involves two effective alloy potential parameters, which account for the respective scattering strengths of Ge and C in the crystal lattice. From our mobility results we have derived an analytical hole mobility model which includes dependencies upon doping concentration, doping type, Ge content and C content. {\textcopyright} 2009.},
