We will discuss specific design issues encountered in the course of developing pandas with relevant examples and some comparisons with the R language. We conclude by discussing possible future directions for statistical computing and data analysis using Python.},

The proposed formulation is suitable for the simulation of III-V heterojunction bipolar transistors as opposed to formulations that employ the single electron gas approximation with a modified velocity-field model, which also causes convergence problems. Based on Boltzmann transport equation simulations, model parameters of the proposed two-valley formulation are given for GaAs, InP, InAs, and GaSb at room temperature. Applications of the new formulation are also demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Data, code, and workflows should be available and cited Over the past two decades, computational methods have radically changed the ability of researchers from all areas of scholarship to process and analyze data and to simulate complex systems. But with these advances come challenges that are contributing to broader concerns over irreproducibility in the scholarly literature, among them the lack of transparency in disclosure of computational methods. Current reporting methods are often uneven, incomplete, and still evolving. We present a novel set of Reproducibility Enhancement Principles (REP) targeting disclosure challenges involving computation. These recommendations, which build upon more general proposals from the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines (1) and recommendations for field data (2), emerged from workshop discussions among funding agencies, publishers and journal editors, industry participants, and researchers representing a broad range of domains. Although some of these actions may be aspirational, we believe it is important to recognize and move toward ameliorating irreproducibility in computational research.}
