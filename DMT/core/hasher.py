""" Creates MD5-HASH from given string-convertable data.

In DMT this is used mainly to ensure unique simulation folders and keys.
A simulation folder consist of 3 parts:

* The simulation directory in used the :ref:`config`
* The dut subfolder named `<dut_name><dut_hash>`. The dut name is a attribute of :ref:`DutView<dut_view>`. The hash calculation depends on the subclass, but most times this is simply the MD5-Hash of all input files, for example the netlist file and the Verilog-AMS code.
* The sweep subfolder named `<sweep_name><sweep_hash>`. The sweep name is a attribute of :ref:`Sweep<sweep>`. The hash is calculated from text converted sweep definition.
