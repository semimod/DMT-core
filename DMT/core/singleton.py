class Singleton(type):
    """Implements the Singleton design pattern. Classes that use this class as a metaclass can only be initiated once.

    If a new object of a singleton class is created, the already existing one is returned.
    Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6760685/creating-a-singleton-in-python

    Here something else is added: If a already existing object is "created" again, it tries to transfer the given kwargs to the old object.

    Examples
    --------

    The simulation controller should only exist once because of possible blocking of resources. This class is used to see singleton in action:

    >>> sim_con1 = SimCon(n_core=4)
    >>> sim_con1.n_core
    4

    If now a second simulation controller is created:

    >>> sim_con2 = SimCon(n_core=8)
    >>> sim_con2.n_core
    8

    The new attribute is overwritten with the new value. As the change is made to the already existing instance, this also has now 8 cores:

    >>> sim_con1.n_core
    8
